            <p><div id=topline>2000: Battlefield Earth:</div>
                John Travolta derailed his career comeback with this would-be science fiction epic, set on an Earth that has been conquered
                by vicious, hairy alien beings.  It's based on a novel by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, and Travolta apparently 
                thought it would start a major film franchise.  He was very, very wrong.  Widely mocked not only for its story, but for inept 
                filmmaking. In his review, film critic Roger Ebert observed that the director <a href=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/battlefield-earth-2000>has 
                learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, but he has not learned why."</a><br /><br />

            <p><div id=topline>2001: Freddy Got Fingered:</div>
                I haven't seen this gross-out comedy, an attempt by sketch comedian Tom Green to stretch his routine to feature length. 
                By all accounts, it's not only relentlessly disgusting, but also entirely unfunny.  I don't feel inclined to test that 
                verdict by actually watching it.<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2002: Swept Away:</div>
                Misguided attempt by pop star Madonna and her then-husband, director Guy Ritchie, to remake Lina Wertmuller's Italian language 
                classic about a spoiled rich woman (Madonna) stranded on a desert island and having to rely on a poor deckhand (Adriano Giannini). 
                In a shocking twist, they fall in love.  Given that the original hasn't exaclty aged well, I'm not sure why either Ritchie or 
                Madonna thought this was a good idea.<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2003: Gigli:</div>
                The stuff of bad movie legend, with Ben Affleck as a small-time mobster paired with a lesbian hit woman (Jennifer Lopez) to 
                kidnap the mentally challenged brother of a federal prosecutor.  In a shocking twist, Affleck and Lopez fall in love.  Set back 
                the careers of both its stars, and effectively destroyed the career of director Martin Brest (who had previously helmed such hits 
                as <strong>Beverly Hills Cop</strong>, <strong>Midnight Run</strong>, and <strong>Scent of a Woman</strong>).<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Bizarre Moment:</strong> When Lopez finally falls for Affleck, she announces, "It's turkey time, gobble-gobble."  It sort 
                of makes sense in context, but it's still pretty much the opposite of a turn-on.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Strangely Awesome Moments:</strong> Cameos by Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, who effortlessly steal the spotlight from 
                their pretty young co-stars. Walken is a police detective, but the important thing is that he brings the full Christopher Walken 
                weirdness. Pacino pops up at the end as a mob figure who calls out just how stupid the entire plot has been before killing one of 
                the bad guys.  Make the whole movie about these two and it might actually have been fun to watch.<br />
                </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2004: Catwoman:</div>
                The first major female led superhero movie since <strong>Supergirl</strong> was an even bigger bomb than that was, with Catwoman 
                Halle Berry facing off against evil cosmetics magnate Sharon Stone.  I haven't seen it, but points to Halle Berry for actually 
                showing up to collect her Worst Actress Razzie in person, in a speech poking fun at her emotional Oscar acceptance from a few years
                prior.<br /><br />

            <p><div id=topline>2005: Dirty Love:</div>
                I also haven't seen this low-budget romantic comedy that was written by star Jenny McCarthy. Story centers around a woman whose 
                life falls apart after she catches her long-time boyfriend with another woman.<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2006: Basic Instinct 2:</div>
                The sequel audiences were waiting for... back in 1993.  By 2006, nobody cared.  Sharon Stone returns as sociopathic novelist 
                Catherine Tramell, now in London but once again a person of interest in a series of murders.  As in the first film, she plays 
                mind games with a police representative - in this case, the psychiatrist (David Morrissey) testifying in her case.  Basically, 
                think the first film, only this time with British accents.  Not really "Worst Picture" material, but also not worth wasting 
                your time with.<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2007: I Know Who Killed Me:</div>
                Lindsay Lohan stars as a young woman who escapes from a serial killer, then insists that she isn't actually the person everyone 
                believes her to be.  I haven't seen it, and I don't intend to, but it has gained status as a so-bad-it's-good "midnight movie."
                <br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2008: The Love Guru:</div>
                Comedian Mike Myers went from superstar to persona-non-grata with this vanity project that he co-wrote and co-produced.  Another 
                one I haven't seen and don't intend to.  Myers plays an Indian guru who dreams of appearing on <strong>The Oprah Winfrey Show</strong>, 
                and who meets and falls in love with pretty sports team owner Jessica Alba.<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2009: Transformers - Revenge of the Fallen:</div>
                Director Michael Bay didn't let a little thing like a writer's strike deter him from delivering a sequel to his smash hit toy robot 
                epic.  In fairness, a finished script is hardly needed: Anyone buying a ticket went to see the robots transform and bash each other. 
                But it takes about half of the seriously overlong running time before we actually get to the real action scenes, with the first half 
                mostly taken up by bad comedy.  Really, really bad comedy.  Still probably not the worst of this particular series... but "I've seen 
                worse" is hardly an accolade.<br /><br />
