            <h2>1980 - 1989</h2>
            <h3>An Overview of Every Movie to Win the Golden Raspberry Award for "Worst Picture."</h3></center>
            <p><div id=topline>1980: Can't Stop the Music:</div>
                The first "Worst Picture" winner is a musical-comedy-romance-drama that fails on all counts.  It's centered around the disco group, 
                <strong>The Village People,</strong> despite the fact that disco was going out of style a good bit before 1980.  The musical 
                numbers advance neither characters nor story; they're just... there every so often.  The movie's dreadful, but sort of endearing; 
                there's nothing mean or even particularly cynical about it.  It's just truly, woefully inept.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Bizarre Moment:</strong> Our "hero," Jack Morell (Steve Guttenberg), after relying on his roommate Sam (Valerie Perrine) to do all the actual work 
                of putting the group together, finally negotiates a contract with a producer. He brings his mother, who does the negotiations for him. 
                And at the end, he's declared a genius... and I suppose getting others to do all your work for you could be considered a type of genius, 
                though not the type to be particularly proud of.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Strangely Awesome Moment:</strong> Midway through the film, the Village People's Glenn Hughes auditions by singing "Danny Boy." 
                A fully faithful, 100% spot-on rendition.  It's the best thing in the movie by far.<br />

            <p><div id=topline>1981: Mommie Dearest:</div>
                Portrayal of actress Joan Collins (Faye Dunaway)'s abuse of adopted daughter Christina, based on Christina's memoir.  Dunaway's 
                performance is a Rorscach test: Thos who have never been in orbit of such a personality will laugh as she has her vocal-chord 
                destroying meltdown about wire hangers.  Those who have known such a personality... will shift uncomfortably in their seats at 
                how disturbingly dead-on the performance actually is.  Not actually good, but extremely well-made.  It's hard enough to credit 
                it being named Worst Picture of 1981... let alone its later title of "Worst Picture of the Decade."<br />
                <br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>1982: Inchon!:</div>
                Sir Laurence Olivier stars as Gen. Douglas MacArthur in this big-budget would-be epic about the early months of the Korean War.  
                Olivier's as miscast as you'd imagine, but he doesn't even give the worst performance.  Ben Gazzara, playing the American officer 
                who's the actual lead character, clearly doesn't want to be there and mostly stands in place delivering his lines in a monotone. 
                Despite the movie being titled after the Battle of Inchon, it almost entirely skips over the climactic battle.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Bizarre Moment:</strong> Olivier's MacArthur persuades the brass to approve his plan for the Inchon attack.  Standard 
                war movie stuff... except that Olivier's clear struggles with his accent result in a lot of strange pauses.  Combined with 
                a few bizarre gestures, the result looks less like a stirring speech and more like some sort of seizure.<br />
                <br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>1983: The Lonely Lady:</div>
                Based on a Harold Robbins novel about a young author (Pia Zadora) who is used and abused as she attempts to sell a screenplay. 
                At a base concept level, there might have been a worthwhile statement to be made.  In execution, it's cheap, badly-acted, 
                and boring.  Has some trivia value as the late Ray Liotta's screen debut, but I'll do you the favor of not describing his 
                role here.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Bizarre Moment:</strong> Pia Zadora has a breakdown that involves showering with her clothes on, followed by psychedelic 
                effects that would make you think this was from the late 1960s instead of the early 1980s.<br />
                <br />         
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>1984: Bolero:</div>
                Bo Derek stars in a film written and directed by her husband, John Derek.  The story concerns heiress Bo's efforts to 
                lose her virginity abroad.  The main character eventually sets her sights on a Spanish bullfighter... and she's so 
                ridiculously entitled that she's surprised when the man's girlfriend has a problem with that!  Not even good as exploitation, 
                as the sex scenes are all off-puttingly weird.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Bizarre Moment:</strong> A sheikh attempts to kidnap Bo, prompting her chauffer (George Kennedy) to try to stop his
                biplane by grabbing its rudder with his bare hands!<br />
                <br />            
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>1985: Rambo - First Blood, Part II:</div>
                Big, dumb action film with Sylvester Stallone's ex-Green Beret going into Vietnam to rescue American POWs. This involves 
                lots of gunfire, some exploding arrows, and a helicopter showdown with - this being the '80s - an evil Russian.  A genuinely 
                stupid movie... but also a rather fun one, as long as you embrace your inner 13 year old, and far too well made to be the 
                worst picture of any year.<br />
                <br />

            <p><div id=topline>1986: Under the Cherry Moon:</div>
                Music superstar Prince plays a gigolo who romances an heiress (Kristin Scott Thomas) for her money.  In a shocking twist, 
                he ends up falling in love with her.  In an even more shocking twist, her father doesn't approve.  Directed by Prince, and 
                shot in black-and-white for reasons that were likely known only to him.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Strangely Awesome Moment:</strong> Midway through the film, Prince woos the heiress by engaging in an impromptu 
                rock number.  It's the only musical number in the movie (not counting credits), and is a reminder that however bad he 
                was as an actor, he was very talented as a performer.<br />
                <br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>1986: Howard the Duck:</div>
                The <i>other</i> "Worst Picture" of 1986 (yes, it was a tie).  Produced by George Lucas, this comic book adaptation 
                follows talking duck Howard as he's transported from Duckworld to Earth in order to make duck puns, get into a 
                really off-putting romance with a young human woman (Lea Thompson), and be generally unpleasant to everyone he meets. 
                Somehow, it failed to strike a chord with audiences... though it has since attracted a cult following.<br />
                <br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>1987: Leonard Part 6:</div>
                Bill Cosby and his ego star as a superspy out to save the world from killer animals controlled by psychotic vegetarians. 
                Reading that sentence, it almost sounds like the film might be amusing.  It's not.  The pace is leaden, every gag 
                fails, and Cosby is dreadful. At less than 90 minutes, this feels longer than <strong>Gone with the Wind.</strong><br />
                <br />
                <strong>Bizarre Moment:</strong> The whole thing?  If I were to pick one scene, it would be Leonard donning ballet slippers and
                a helmet so that his stunt double can dance-fight with vegetarian assassins.  Again, if that sounds potentially amusing... it isn't.<br />
                <br />            
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>1988: Cocktail:</div>
                Tom Cruise plays a young man with a drive to become rich but no actual skills.  He's taken under the wing of a crusty 
                Australian bartender (Bryan Brown), before eventually falling for Elisabeth Shue.  In a shocking twist, her father 
                disapproves.  Utterly formulaic, but perfectly fine for what it is.  Definitely not Worst Picture material.<br />
                <br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>1989: Star Trek V - The Final Frontier:</div>
                William Shatner directs, which goes about as well as you'd expect.  After a very long, mostly narratively 
                pointless mission, Spock's renegade Vulcan half-brother (Laurence Luckinbill) takes control of the <b>Enterprise</b>, 
                and embarks on a quest to find God.  On the way, they must overcome perils that include bad special effects, woeful 
                use of the supporting cast, and lots of really bad comedy.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Bizarre Moment:</strong> The heroes need to distract a horde of enemies.  So Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) 
                performs an impromptu fan dance.  Somehow, this works.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Strangely Awesome Moment:</strong> The bad comedy stops for a genuinely well-written scene exploring 
                the emotional wounds of Spock and Dr. McCoy.  How it crept into this otherwise woeful script is anyone's 
                guess.<br />
