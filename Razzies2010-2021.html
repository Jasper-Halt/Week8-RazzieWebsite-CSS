            <p><div id=topline>2010: The Last Airbender:</div>
                Director M. Night Shyamalan adapts the acclaimed Nickelodeon animated series... by compressing the entire plot of the 
                20-episode first season into a single 90 minute movie.  Lots and lots of narration is used to try to keep the story coherent, 
                as Airbender Aang (Noah Ringer) awakens from a century encased in ice to discover that his people have been wiped out, and that 
                the evil Fire Nation is on the brink of conquering the world.  Leaden dialogue and stilted performances abound.  Released in theaters
                in 3D, but the gimmick is so poorly applied that there's no real difference between the 2D and 3D versions.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Strangely Awesome Moment:</strong> The final battle ends when Aang summons a tsunami that puts the Fire Nation into full 
                retreat.  In contrast to the rest of the film, the music and the visual effects actually work and the image is genuinely impressive. 
                Then the moment ends, and we return to bad dialogue and worse acting.<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2011: Jack and Jill:</div>
                Adam Sandler as an advertising exec who is visited by his obnoxious twin sister (also Sandler) at the same time that he's trying to 
                woo Al Pacino into doing a Dunkin' Donuts commercial.  Haven't seen it, don't intend to.  I've never found Sandler funny - and even
                most of his fans didn't think much of this project.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Strangely Awesome Moment:</strong> Thanks to YouTube, I have seen Al Pacino's in-film "Dunkaccino" commerical, which is 
                deliberately bad... and absolutely hilarious, as Pacino does a song-and-dance number while lampooning his own iconic roles.  The 
                scene ends with an absolutely perfect comic button.  On its own, it would make for a brilliant five-minute sketch - but I'm not 
                about to watch the whole movie just to see it in context.<br /><br />

            <p><div id=topline>2012: The Twilight Saga - Breaking Dawn, Part 2:</div>
                I've never seen any of the <strong>Twilight</strong> movies, and I have no intention of changing that.  This was the series' final 
                entry, in which Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and her vampire lover, Edward (Robert Pattinson) find themselves in the middle of a 
                vampire war after having a baby.  Not generally regarded as the worst of the series; I suspect the Razzie was given to represent 
                the entire <b>Twilight</b> saga, rather than just this specific entry.<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2013: Movie 43:</div>
                Another one I've never seen.  A sketch comedy with an impressive cast: Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Emma Stone, Dennis Quaid, Halle 
                Berry, Richard Gere, Elizabeth Banks, Uma Thurman, and many many more.  The sketches were shot over several years around the actors'
                schedules.  The end results pleased almost no one.  Film critic Richard Roeper dubbed it <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/movie-43-2013">
                the <strong>Citizen Kane</strong> of awful."</a><br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2014: Saving Christmas:</div>
                I'm not religious, but I have  seen some genuinely good faith-based movies.  None of those included the name "Kirk Cameron" 
                among their credits.  Cameron directs and stars in this vanity project that purports to be a celebration of the true 
                meaning of Christmas.  It mainly ends up as a celebration of Cameron's own ego, as he plays himself and spends much of the 
                running time directly lecturing the viewers.  Rejected even by its target audience, which Cameron blamed on a conspiracy by 
                atheists.  Because the true meaning of Christmas is that it's always someone else's fault.<br /><br />

                <figcaption>Kirk Cameron lectures the audience from his living room.  No, really.</figcaption></center>    
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2015: Fifty Shades of Grey:</div>
                2015 saw the Razzies' first tie since 1990.  The first of the two, ah, "winners" was this supposedly erotic drama, based on the 
                unintentionally hilarious bestseller.  Dakota Johnson plays a 21 year old college student who interviews billionaire Christian
                Grey (Jamie Dornan) for the campus newspaper.  They end up falling in love, and then she discovers Grey's penchant for BDSM. 
                Bad on pretty much every level, though arguably a slight improvement over its source material.<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2015: Fantastic Four:</div>
                Genius and unlikable prick Reed Richards (Miles Teller) is recruited into a government-sponsored research institute, where he 
                and some sort-of friends build a working teleporter.  When they violate orders to use it themselves, rather than wait for experts, 
                an accident gives them incredible powers... which they barely ever actually use. Studio-mandated 
                reshoots resulted in most of the second half being changed; it's probably no coincidence that the second half is where this goes 
                from merely bad to incoherent.  Who knew that the cheesy 2005 version with Jessica Alba and Chris Evans would end up being the 
                <i>good</i> one?<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2016: Hillary's America - The Secret History of the Democratic Party:</div>
                A Dinish D'Souza "documentary."  Haven't seen it, don't intend to.<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2017: The Emoji Movie:</div>
                I also haven't seen this infamously bad animated comedy.  The plot centers on Gene (T. J. Miller), an emoji who is an outsider because 
                he has multiple expressions.  With help from various other emojis, including the Poop Emoji (Patrick Stewart), he eventually 
                defeats the evil Smiley emoji (Maya Rudolph) and learns to accept himself for who he is.  Aww...  Yeah, I think I'll continue to 
                skip this.<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2018: Holmes & Watson:</div>
                Since I find Will Ferrell even less funny than Adam Sandler, this Sherlock Holmes spoof is yet another one I haven't seen.  Holmes 
                and his associate, Dr. Watson (John C. Reilly) become involved in a plot to assassinate Queen Victoria.  Ralph Fiennes plays 
                Professor Moriarty - casting that might actually work in a proper Holmes film.<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2019: Cats:</div>
                <strong>Les Miserables</strong> director Tom Hooper tries to replicate that success by adapting Andrew Lloyd Webber's beloved 
                stage musical.  The first problem: <strong>Cats</strong> barely has a plot, which already makes it pretty hard to adapt as a 
                satisfying movie.  The second problem: Hooper attempts to use CGI to transform his admittedly impressive cast into humanoid 
                cats, with results that flew past the uncanny valley before crashing into the Treehouse of Terror.<br /><br />

            <p><div id=topline>2020: Absolute Proof:</div>
                Another political "documentary," this one by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, purporting to prove that the 2020 Presidential Election 
                was stolen.  I wish the Razzies would stop giving the award to political documentaries.  Bad comedies, dramas, and musicals can 
                be fun to mock; political manifestos are not. Anyway... I didn't watch this, and I don't plan to.<br />
            </p>
            <p><div id=topline>2021: Diana - The Musical:</div>
                File under the "What were they thinking?" category.  This is a filmed Broadway stage musical about the life of Diana Spencer. 
                There are some genuinely talented people involved; writer/lyricist Joe DiPietro and musician David Bryan previously won Tony Awards 
                for their musical, <strong>Memphis.</strong> Everything appears to have gone wrong here, however, with critical consensus declaring 
                it an exploitative show that doesn't even offer decent musical numbers.  There's not much sadder than a failed, would-be prestige 
                piece.
