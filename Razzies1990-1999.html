            <p><div id=topline>1990: Ghosts Can't Do It:</div>
            1990 was another tie.  The first of the two "Worst Pictures" sees the return of star/producer Bo Derek and her 
            husband, writer/director John Derek, who previously gave us <strong>Bolero.</strong>  Screen veteran Anthony 
            Quinn embarrasses himself as Bo's older husband, who dies early on.  Then he comes back as a ghost to urge 
            her to kill someone so that he can possess the victim's body.  Bear in mind, these are the people we're meant 
            to root for.  As bad as <strong>Bolero,</strong> but at least this one is only 90 minutes!<br />

        <p><div id=topline>1990: The Adventure of Ford Fairlane:</div>
            1990's other "Worst Picture" stars comedian Andrew Dice Clay as a private eye trying to solve the murder of a 
            heavy-metal singer.  Mostly bad as both a mystery and a comedy, but it's watchable enough.  It's certainly nowhere 
            near as bad as <strong>Ghosts Can't Do It.</strong><br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p><div id=topline>1991: Hudson Hawk:</div>
            Bruce Willis plays cat burglar Hudson Hawk who, along with his partner Tommy (Danny Aiello), is blackmailed into performing one last job. 
            He finds himself sucked into intrigue involving a rogue CIA operative (James Coburn), corporate espionage, Leonardo da Vinci, 
            and the Vatican.  Really dumb, mostly unfunny, and yet kind of fun if it catches you in the right frame of mind.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Strangely Awesome Bizarre Moment:</strong> Hudson and Tommy use old songs to time their activities, singing Bing Crosby's 
            <strong>Swinging' on a Star</strong> throughout the commission of the First Act robbery.  It's as dumb as everything else, but 
            it's oddly entertaining.<br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p><div id=topline>1992: Shining Through:</div>
            Old-fashioned romantic espionage set against World War II, with secretary/movie buff Melanie Griffith drawn into a romance with 
            her employer (Michael Douglas), a U. S. intelligence officer.  For reasons too stupid to detail, she ends up being drafted into 
            a covert mission in Nazi Germany.  There's not a single moment that's remotely convincing, and the heroine spends the whole film 
            making one dumb decision after another.  Still, this sudsy melodrama is nicely produced, generally well-acted, and enjoyable 
            enough to watch.  Definitely not the stuff of "Worst Picture" awards.<br />
            <br />

        <p><div id=topline>1993: Indecent Proposal:</div>
            Wealthy Robert Redford meets poor married couple Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson, and upends their marriage by offering them $1 million 
            to sleep with Moore.  This sleazy soap opera might represent a career low point for Redford, whose dignity was apparently on vacation.  
            There are a few good moments thanks to co-star Oliver Platt, very funny as the couple's lawyer (yes, this impoverished couple has 
            a lawyer at hand).<br />

        <p><div id=topline>1994: Color of Night:</div>
            Bruce Willis plays a psychiatrist who takes over a colleague's patients to try to find out which of them killed him.  In the course 
            of his investigation, he gets involved with patient Jane March, and we are shown more of Little Bruce than anyone wanted to see.  
            For all of its faults (most of which come from being forced into being a post-<strong>Basic Instinct</strong> "erotic thriller"), 
            this isn't a <i>bad</i> film, particularly in its director's cut.  Still far from a career highlight for anyone involved.<br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p><div id=topline>1995: Showgirls:</div>
            Director Paul Verhoeven's infamous megabomb about a stripper (Elizabeth Berkeley) and her quest to become a respectable Vegas 
            showgirl.  In retrospect, it just about works as a camp comedy ala <strong>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</strong>, and it's attracted 
            a cult following in the decades since.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Bizarre Moment:</strong> Elizabeth Berkeley has sex in a swimming pool... though it looks more as if she's in need of an 
            exorcist.<br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p><div id=topline>1996: Striptease:</div>
            Two big-budget stripper movies in two years?  This time, our heroine is Demi Moore, who takes a job at a strip club so that she can 
            be financially stable enough to win back custody of her daughter.  The local drugstore wasn't hiring?  Based on a Carl Hiassen novel 
            that was probably good.  The movie isn't, though co-star Burt Reynolds is enthusiastically off-kilter as a perverted congressman.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Bizarre Moment:</strong> Burt Reynolds' campaign manager walks in on him covered in vaseline and sniffing dryer lint.  Reynolds 
            begins marching around, exulting in the way he can "feel it squishin' between my toes!" I think this is meant to be funny, but it's 
            mainly just very, very strange.

        <p><div id=topline>1997: The Postman:</div>
            I haven't seen this one, though I suspect it's better than several of the ones I have seen.  Star/director Kevin Costner presents a 
            post-apocalyptic epic about a drifter in a postman's uniform who restores hope among the residents of a frontier settlement.  
            Critically reviled on release, though it's since gained a cult following.<br />
        <br />
        </p>
        <p><div id=topline>1998: An Alan Smithee Film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn!:</div>
            <b>Monty Python</b> alum Eric Idle tries and fails to get laughs as an indie film director wooed by Hollywood money into making a big 
            studio film.  He's so appalled by the result that he resolves to steal the negative and destroy it.  Like Blake Edwards' <strong>S. O. B.</strong>,
            only minus any actual satire.  Made worse by the choice to film it as a mock documentary; most of the story happens offscreen, with
            major events described.  The results are sometimes confusing and almost always boring.<br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p><div id=topline>1999: Wild Wild West:</div>
            <strong>Men in Black</strong> director Barry Sonnenfeld reunites with star Will Smith for a decidedly <strong>MIB</strong>-like take on 
            the classic television series.  Smith and co-star Kevin Kline play mismatched Secret Service operatives who are teamed, against their will, 
            to investigate missing scientists and a plot against the U. S. government.  I'd say they learn to respect each other... but that would 
            be a lie, as Smith and Kline bicker with seemingly genuine dislike the entire way through the picture.  I doubt that it's truly the worst film 
            of 1999, but it might be the most misjudged.<br />
            <br />
